# 🌐 Slate | High-Output Infrastructure Intelligence

Slate is a production-grade Saas style infrastructure intelligence platform designed to bridge the gap between complex backend services and actionable user analytics. By leveraging a high-performance, cloud-native architecture, Slate provides real-time visibility into deployed services, subscription states, and manage these useres on a system-level on one admin dashboard.

## 🛠 Architectural Intelligence

Slate provides a segregated, secure control plane to manage both subscriber access and administrative oversight:

* **User Dashboard:** A high-fidelity interface for subscribers to monitor their active service instances, view expiration metrics, and manage subscription lifecycles.
* **Admin Control Plane:** A secure, elevated portal for monitoring platform-wide infrastructure health, managing user access levels, and auditing system-wide financial and operational events.
* **System Operational Status:** Real-time, heartbeat-driven monitoring of active ledger counts and overall infrastructure health.

## 🔍 Engineering Capabilities

### Dual-Dashboard Authorization
Slate implements role-based access control (RBAC). The application architecture distinguishes between standard user sessions and administrative sessions, ensuring that infrastructure oversight tools are protected by elevated verification logic.

### Secure Payment Orchestration
Slate utilizes a signature-verified Stripe Webhook Architecture. We eliminate race conditions and data tampering by parsing raw-body event streams, ensuring that your system state is always a 1:1 reflection of your financial reality.

### Distributed CORS Security
Operating across distinct cloud environments (Vercel & Railway), we have implemented a strictly audited CORS allowlist to maintain military-grade isolation between the dashboard clients and the backend API.
